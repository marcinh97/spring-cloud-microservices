# Spring Cloud microservices
Kotlin-based Spring Cloud template to quickly bootstrap a simple application with:
- configuration server (for centralized configuration of microservices)
- Eureka discovery server (to automatically register newly added microservices)
- 2 sample microservices with a one-way Feign connection (from sample-service to lang-service)
